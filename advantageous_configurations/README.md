These files are a listing of all configurations found for which the optimal hyperbit strategy has an advantage over the optimal classical strategy. 

The filenames are of the form `advantageous_configs_n.txt` where `n` is the number of cards left in the shoe.

Each line of each file follows the same format: 
```Bob facedown, Dealer facedown || The n cards in the shoe (comma separated) || Hyperbit value, Classical value, Hyperbit advantage```

Here we do not distinguish 10s and face cards, as they are all be treated as the same value of 10.
